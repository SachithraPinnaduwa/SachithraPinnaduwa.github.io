    <p>Sports have been an integral part of my life, shaping my character,
         teaching me valuable life lessons, and offering a platform for self-expression.
        This journey began in grade 6 when I started playing football for Maliyadeva College.
        I held the right defense position, which was both a challenging and rewarding experience.
        From there, my sports life has been an exhilarating ride, filled
         with triumphs and a few setbacks.</p><br>

      <p>  My football journey commenced with my enrollment at Maliyadeva
         College. I vividly remember the excitement and anxiety I felt during my first practice session.
          Little did I know that this was the beginning of a life-long
           love for the sport.
          Over the years, I honed my skills, learned the art of teamwork,
           and developed a deep passion for the game.</p><br>

    <p> As a right defender, my role was crucial in providing a solid
         defensive foundation for the team.
        I had to be quick on my feet, anticipate the opponent's moves,
         and ensure that the opposing forwards had a tough time breaking through our defense.
        The bond with my teammates and the satisfaction of contributing
         to our victories fueled my dedication to the game.</p><br>

    <p>  One of the most memorable aspects of my football journey was
         the numerous district and provincial matches we participated in.
        These matches were intense, and the competition was fierce.
         Yet, with hard work and perseverance, our team achieved 
         significant victories, etching our names in the annals of Maliyadeva College's sports history.
        These experiences taught me the value of discipline,
         teamwork, and resilience.</p><br>

    <p>  As I transitioned to university life at the Informatics Institute
         of Technology (IIT), my passion for football remained undiminished.
        I continued to play for my university, albeit in a more competitive environment.
        The camaraderie I shared with my new teammates, the relentless 
        training sessions, and the rush of representing my university on
         the field has been an integral part of my university experience.</p><br>

    <p>   While football has been a constant in my sports life,
         I also ventured into chess during my early school years.
        From grade 6 to grade 10, I dedicated a significant amount
         of time to this intellectually challenging game.
        Chess taught me a different set of skills compared to football.
         It was a game of strategy, foresight, and mental acumen.</p><br>

    <p>  The decision to step away from chess in grade 10 was a tough one.
         I had to prioritize my studies as I was getting ready for the GCE Ordinary Level exams.
        While I missed the chessboard, I recognized the importance of 
        academic achievements, and the need to strike a balance in my life.
        The lessons I learned from chess, such as critical thinking, patience,
         and the ability to plan ahead, continue to serve me well in my academic pursuits.</p><br>

    <p>  My sports journey, from the football field to the chessboard,
         has been a profound and transformative experience.
        It has taught me the values of discipline, teamwork,
         perseverance, and time management.
        Whether it's defending the goal on the football pitch or 
        outwitting my chess opponents, I have found joy, learning, 
        and personal growth in both these sports.</p><br>

    <p>   Today, as I continue to play football at the university 
        level, I carry with me the experiences and lessons from my early days at Maliyadeva College.
        My journey reminds me that sports are not just about winning
         or losing, but about personal growth, self-discovery, and the lifelong bonds forged with teammates.
        And although I've temporarily set aside chess, the skills
         and qualities it instilled in me remain an integral part of my character.</p>

    <p>  In conclusion, my sports life has been a story of 
        dedication, perseverance, and self-improvement.
        Whether on the football field or the chessboard, my journey has been
         a testament to the transformative power of sports in shaping one's character and outlook on life.
        I look forward to the new challenges and opportunities
         that both football and chess will continue to offer in the
          future, as I navigate my path through university and beyond.</p>
